# Floyd-s-cycle-finding-algorithm
This algorithm is an efficient method for detecting cycles in a linked list. It uses two pointers (often called the "tortoise" and the "hare") that traverse the data structure at different speeds: The tortoise moves one step at a time. The hare moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the hare will eventually meet the tortoise inside theloop. This algorithm is also called "Fast-slow algorithm"
